To rename a file in git 
	first rename the file 
	then do git add 
	then git remove the previous named file (file with older name)
	then do git status and you will se that the git will know that the file renamed 
	git commit 


 another method to rename a file in git is 
	git mv old_file_name new_file_name 
 
 this can also be used to move the file into another directory which can be done in the following way
	1. create the directory through file explorer
	2. let the file name be file1.txt
	3. let the name of the dir be folder1

	4. git mv file1.txt folder1/file1.txt

	5. you can move and rename the file at the same time 


To commit everything without adding the file to the staging area type
	git commit -am "the message you want to type with commit"


To remove a file from the staging area just type
	git reset HEAD <name of the file>

to go to a previous commit 
	git checkout <commit id > <file that you want>


To see what changes have been made in a specific commit 
	git show <commit id>


To connect with the web repository 
	git add remote <origin> <url>

To push something into the repository
	git push -u origin master


to update the github log file so that the user can get the latest commit 
	git pull
