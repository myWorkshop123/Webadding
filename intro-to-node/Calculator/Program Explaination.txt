this is very important explaination 

We loaded 2 modules => 1) Express  2)Body-parser 

1) Express = this module is used to create server and send response to the browser request 

2) Body-parser = this module is used to use the response which the browser sends to the server 
                  in a very usefull way 


app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    this function is use to encode the form values 

the functionality goes like this 

we started the server using app.listen 

we opened the browser and entered localhost:3000 

the browser went to server and opened the root directory

at the root directory we sent the index.html as a response to the browser request using the app.get() method 

in the index.html we had a form in which the user entered the values and pressed the submit button 

the browser sent the form values as a response to the server 

at the server to get these form values we addedd the body-parser module 

by using the body-parser module we first changed the encoding using the app.use(body-parser.urlencoded({ extented:true }))

after changing the way in which the browser sends the data we will again use req.body method to get the values of the html elements

now using the res.send method we will send the result as a response
