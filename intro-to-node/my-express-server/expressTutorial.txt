express is used to additional functionality to the node js
it is just a module which is used to make a local server

to make a server
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    app.listen(3000 , function(){
        console.log("the server has started");

    })

    explaination
        in the first statement we inserted the express module using require statement
        int the second statement, to make the work easy we use a const to put the value of function
        express() , so the constant can be used to call other methods



app.get() method
  this method is used to send the response to the browser , who request the route
  ("/") from the user
  In the layman terms we can say that when we seted up our server and when we open
  the browser and search for localhost:portNumber
  the browser sends the request to the server about the page
  now before the app.get() , the server was unable to respond to that request
  but now the app.get() method allow us to respond to the server request
	app.get(" directory " , callBack function(request , response) {
		response.send("this is the home directory");
		});


__dirname keyword
  this is used to get the location of the current file
  because our website will not only be hosted from our own computer but also can be or will be hosted
  from any other server or a cloud server for which we do not know the path of the file which we are
  referring to so that's why we use the __dirname keyword to get the address/path of the current directory
  and thus navigating through that path


res.sendFile() method
  this is used to send a file from the server in response to the browser request
  earlier we used to send a single line of code or statement using the res.send() method
  This method allows use to send a whole file
  It takes the location/path of the file as a parameter which is done with the help of __dirname
