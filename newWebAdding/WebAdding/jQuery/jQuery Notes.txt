all the DOM reference which we used is just replaced by a dollar sign ($) 
so if you want to select h1 just type 
    $("h1")

it is used for everything to select 

to go into a css property 
    $("h1").css(" property you want to change " , " the value you want to give ")

    you can also get the value of the property by typing 
    
    console.log( $("h1").css(" property ") )
        
        this command will give the value of that specific property on that tag 


addClass() method 
    to add a class to the html element 
        $("h1").addClass(" name of the class1  ");
        
        (YOU CAN ALSO ADD MULTIPLE CLASSESS BY JUST ADDING A SPACE IN BETWEEN)


removeClass() Method 
    the same syntax goes for removing a class 
        $("h1").removeClass(" name of the class ");



.hasClass() Method 
    to check whether a particular class is present in the element or not 
        $("h1").hasClass(" name of the class ");


.text() Method  
    this is used to manipulate the text of an element
        Syntax  
            $("h1").text(" the text you want to add ");


.html() Method 
    this is used to add html inside that particular element
        Syntax
            $("h1").html(" the html code that you want to insert ");


.attr() Method
    it is used to get or set the value of attribute of an html element 

    Syntax 
        $("h1").attr("name of the attribute " , "the value you want to give to the attribute")

    the second the argument is kept blank in case you want to get the value.
    You can also use it to get the css class of the html element as we have did
