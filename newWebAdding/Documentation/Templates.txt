Date class 
    this class is used to get the current date

first you have to make a object called 
var date = new Date();

date.getDay()
    this will return the current day in the form of a number starting from sunday as 0


date.toLocaleDateString('en-US' , options) 
    this will return the date in your desired format by taking in the parameters specified in the options 
    objects 
    So the options object will be make like this 

    var options = {
        year:'numeric', day:'numeric' , weekday:'long' , month:'long'
    }

    the values numeric means in numeral form and long means in word format
