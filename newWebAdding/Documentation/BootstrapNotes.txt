bootstrap is used to implement css

there are two ways to add bootstrap
    1.Download the bootstrap and refer through the link tag in the website
    2.Use the CDN (Content Delivary Network ) link provided in the website
      to add the bootstrap

We will use the 2nd way


WIREFRAMES
  these are a kind of blueprint of the website which the developer makes with the help
  of copy and pen
  like a rough sketch of the website

MOCKUP
  these are also kind of blueprint of the website which shows the final product of the website



NAVIGATION BAR
  it is used to add navigation header to the website using bootstrap.
  for eg:-
    home button , contact button , download button = all these buttons are available in the header part of he website so that the user can be directed straight away to that page

  Classes
    1. navbar = for adding nav bar
    2.



  to implement the navigation bar
  1. Add the <nav> tag in the html
  2.



Window 10 notes time = 3:07 I have entered the notes on macbook (the previous version ) at 12:00pm

Note = Any animation to the website will only be added through javascript so make sure to add js code with bootstrap link

Layout
  there are two things in this
    1. col class
    2. row class

    1. col class
        the width of the screen is divided into 12 columns when we add the col class in the div it divides the screen with the number of
        col class used in the tags
        for eg
        <div class="row">
         <div class="col" style="background-color:red; border:1px solid;<h4>Heading 4</h4>">
            col
         </div>
        </div>

        this will create only one column in the whole screen

        if we create two divs with col classes then it will divide the width of the screen with 2 and will place two cols on the screen

        The other more efficient method is to add a number with the col to denote
        like col-3
        to give that part of the screen to that column where is is considered that the screen is divided into 12 parts

      to make the no of columns to apear dynamically depending upon the screen size use "col-screenSize-number"
      number = values discussed earlier
      screenSize = lg = large
                   md = medium
                   sm = small


      the statement "col-lg-6" means that that column will occuppy 12/6 part of the screen when the screen size will be large, if the screen size
      goes less than that then it will occuppy 100% of the screen


Container
  containers are included in the div class
  there are two types of containers
    1. Container
        it will not adjust with the screen i.e it will keep a margin
    2. Container-fluid
        it will adjust the text automatically with the size of the screen and also all the contents of the website


Carousel
  the Carousel control is used to add the functionality of the slider in the website
  to add the Carousel see the bootstrap documentation
  the other properties which we can change in the Carousel are as follows
    1. data-interval
        we can set the interval between each slide using this property
        For eg: data-interval="1000"
          it will take 1 second of interval to move to the next slide


    2. data-pause="hover"
        the slider will be paused when the mouse will be hovered on one of them

    3. data-ride="false"
        this property is set to true to play the slider automatically


Cards
  these are used to display price in the form of card


z-index
  it is used to stack one element on top of the other, just like a z axis we put
  the element in front of the other element

  the property is "z-index"
  another important thing is that it cannot be done without giving the position
  element to the element

media-query

  is used as @media-query (condition) {

      the css styles
  }


  it is used to add the responsiveness to the website without the bootstrap
  it acts as a conditional for the css


hierarchical selectors
these are the selectors which are used to target a specific element
For eg
  if there are two div 's where two anchor tags with the same class name exist
  so if one div has the class=" firstDiv "
  and the other div has the class= " secondDiv "
  and the two anchor tags has the class = "sameAnchor "
  then
    if the programmer wants to target just the anchor tag inside the
    " secondDiv " div then he will write
    in css
    .secondDiv .sameAnchor{
      css property
    }
