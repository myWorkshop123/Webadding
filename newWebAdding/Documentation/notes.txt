things which are discussed 

Table 
    explain how data is inserted inside the html table 
        tr 
        td
        th
        thead
        tbody
        tfoot
            different tableBody tags are required to 
            first make the table look good 
            and also to style each section of the table 
            using javascipt and css


        cellspacing
        border = for making a grid appear around the entries giving it a table like view 


    very important thing 
    to make a sub table inside a table meaning to 
    divide the table 
    just after nesting use the table html tag to 
    create a new table do not go further nesting with tr and tds 
    as it will break the table structure 

    in short the nesting of the tr and td must be minimum 
    if the level goes more than 2 use 
    another table instead of tr's and td's

    (another tip is to use live server while creating a table using html)



HTML Forms

    1.<form>
        contains two attributes 
            a. action
                the place where the information goes 
                    (can be a html page)
            b. method 
                the http function which is used to send the data 
                    (can be get or set)
    
    2. input 
        this class contains all the widgets used in form these are  as follows
            a. textbox
            b. Submit button
            c. Checkbox
            d. Radiobutton
        refer to mdn to use them 

    3. Label
    

CSS 
    these are used for designing the web page
    the basic syntax of any type of css code goes like this 
    what_you_want_to_change{
        what_you_want_to_change_about_it:what_is_the_change
    }

    there are three types of css 
        1) inline
            adds the css style in the tag as an attribute
            
            for eg:-
                <body style="background-color:blue;" >
        
        
        2) internal 
            add the css in the head portion of the web page 
            
            for eg:-
                <head>
                    body {
                        background-color:Red;
                    }


                <head>
        
        
        3) external 
            add the css in a seperate file and refer it inside the html 
            we use a link tag in the head section of the html 
            it has 2 attributes:
                a. rel 
                    relation. it tells the browser that what is relation b/w this page and the file linked to it. in case 
                    of css it is the stylesheet
                
                b. href 
                    specifies the location of the file 

    css Properties 
        a. background-color
                changes the color of the background
                    syntax
                        background-color:the_color;


    there are many more just refer to mdn documentation


the basic syntax of external css goes like this 
    syntax 
        selector{
            property:value;
        }
    for eg:-
        body{
            background:red;
        }

    here the selector is body which specifies who is going to be changed 
    there are many different types of selectors which will be described below 

(NOTE)=====> the tag selector have the lowest property of all the selectors meaning if there is some other selectors and a tag selector pointing towards 
            changing the same property then the browser will only implement the other selector Properties

        1. Tag selectors
            these selectors are named as their tags.
            for eg:-
                body,h1,h2,p etc 
        
        2. class selectors
            these selectors are used to differentiate between same tags.
            
            These are the steps which are used to define the class selectors
              a. First add a class attribute in the tag and give it a name of your own choice 
              b. In the linked css file in the place of selectors add the following lines

                    syntax
                        .class_name{
                            property:value;
                        }
                    for eg:-(refer to index.html for info about the image)
                        .grapes{
                            background-color:red;
                        }

            
        3. id selectors
            just like class selectors id selectors are also used to differentiate the tags the only difference is that 
            you cannot have two tags with the same id whereas in class you can have multiple tags as the same class 

            steps to implement id selectors are as follows
                a. first add the id attribute in the tag and give it a name of your own choice 
                b. in the linked css file add the following lines 

                    syntax 
                        #id_name{
                            property:value;
                        }

                    for eg
                        #authorTitle{
                            color:saddlebrown;
                        }


((NOTE))======> You can add more than one class inside a tag but cannot add more than one id ------------------------------

    for eg 
    <img class="class1 class2" src="the source" alt="">

    in the css
    .class1 {
        background-color:red;
    }

    .class2 {
        border-radius:100%;
    }

    but you cannot do the same thing with ids

CSS pseudo classes 
    -> they specify a special state of the selected element 
    -> they start with :name_of_pseudoClass 
    -> for eg 
        :hover 
        specifies the hover state meaning what will happen if the mouse if hovered over the element 

    -> how to use pseudo classes 
        selector:name_of_pseudoClass {
            property:values;                    
        }

Favicons 
    these are a type of logos which appear on the left side of the tab inside the page 
    to make on follow the steps 
    1. download the favicon from favicon.cc 
    2. make a link tag and in the rel tag type icon 


DIV element
    <di> the div element or the division class is used to make divisions in the html page to put things in the container 
    
    THE BOX MODEL
        -> This model states that each element in html is made up of boxes. A box has the following css properties which can be manipulated.
        a. Height and Width
        b. border
        c. Padding
        d. Margin

        -> Explaination of all of the above 
            a. Height and width = it specifies the Height and width of the box 

            b. Border = It specifies the dimensions of the border 

            c. Padding = It means the space between the things inside the box and border

            d. Margin/boundry = It refers to the space which a box keeps between another box 

        -> All of these can be seen in the form of box in the inspect element tab of the chrome where a box is made that contains a gui with which these values can be 
           manipulated graphically.
        

SPAN html element
    A <span> element is like a div element it is like a box which has dimensions equal to  only the contents inside. 
    Only problem with the span element is that you cannot change the width 

Visibility CSS property
    it takes that element and hides it but it doesn't deletes it position unlike the none property of the display 
    attribute which deletes the element as well as its position 


Display CSS property
    It is a CSS property of html elements 
    there are 4 values of this property
        1. Block
            there are html elements which take the whole horizontal space of the screen, you can see that in pesticide extension 
            that these elements take the whole width of the screen while displaying due to which the next element will inserted in the next line 
            these are
                headers (<h>)
                paragraphs (<p>)
                lists and list items(<li>)(<ol>)
                Divisions <div>
                Forms <forms>


                
        2. Inline 
            Inline Display element only takes that much space it needs to. 
            The only problem is that you cannot change the width of the element.
            these are 
                Image element <img> 
                Anchor element <a>
                span element   <span>

        3. Block-Inline 
            It is an inline element whose width can be changed.
            Syntax 
                display:inline-block;

        4. None 
            it just removes the display property of the element. Remember it doesn't removes the element. 
            It appears that the element is deleted as the position and the element both get deleted 

        5. Visibility
            we can also hide the element keeping its position at the same place by using Visibility property 
            Syntax:
                Visibility:hidden;


POSITION CSS property
    As the name suggests it is used to position the css element 
    it has 4 types. after specifying the type the user has to give the values to further four attributes.
    these are as follows 
        1. top 
        2. bottom
        3. left 
        4. right 

    It is not necessary to give values to all of them it is just which distance which u want to change
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    it has 4 types 
        a. Static 
            it is the default position property of the elements which the html gives to each element which we discussed in the display property above 

        b. Relative 
            Relative attribute changes the position of the elements with respect to its Static position before.
            Syntax:
                selector {
                    position:Relative:
                    top:50px;
                } 

        c. Absolute 
            Absolute changes the position of the element with respect to the parent element. The flow of the other element continues.
            Syntax:
            selector {
                position:Absolute;
                direction:value;
            }

        d.Fixed 
            Fixed values changes the position of the element with respect to the parent element.
            But the only difference is the element will remain fixed on that portion of the screen even if the users scroll down.
            Syntax:
            selector {
                position: fixed;
                direction: value;
            }
TEXT ALLIGN PROPERTY 
    the text-align css property is used to align everything in the element 

THE AUTO MARGIN value
    after aligning the content some element will be shifted towards one side 
    so to overcome this issue we gill value auto the margin property of 
    that element

font-family property
    it is used to change the font of the element
    to get the fonts use fonts.google.com 
        1. add the fonts 
        2. copy the href link and paste it in the head tag 
        3. copy the css and paste it in the css file 
        

font-size property
    px 
    percentage = for changing dynamically 
    em = for changing the size dynamically
    100 % = 16px = 1 em
    the percentage and em add the font inherited from their parent tag 
    So, in this condition we always use rem value 
    rem = it is a value of the size of the font which specifies that no matter what the 
    font size in the parent is i will only choose the one which is specified


FLOAT AND CLEAR 
    FLOAT        
        the float is used to wrap the text around a image.
        float is applied to the image or the thing around which the text is wraped
        Syntax:
            selector {
                float: direction;
            }
    CLEAR
        the clear is used to clear the float property of an element which is wraped 
        to a element using float 
        Syntax:
            selector {
                clear: direction;
            }
