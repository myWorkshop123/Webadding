INTRODUCTION

this file contains advanced javascript functions and methods which are used to 
add more complex functionality to the javascript



================================================================================================================

EVENT LISTENER 

    As the name just it will listen to events which will happen and will execute a function accordingly

    for eg 
        You went to a party and you told your dad to pick you up when you will call him 
        Here, Your father is the event listener, your call is the event it will listen to and him 
        bringing the car to pick you up is the function which will called when the calling event will happen



    just like that in javascript the event listener will be added to html element 
    so the syntax goes like this 
        html_Element.addEventListener("the event to listen to", the function to be called )

    Note = The function calling will be done without the parenthesis because the if we applied the 
            parenthesis to the function , the function will be called by the event Listener as the page 
            is loaded into the browser without listening to the event 


ANONYMUS FUNCTION 
        these are the function without the names and they are used when the user will not call the function 

    in the addEventListener function in calling_function section we can add this anonymus function in this 
    way 

    html_Element.addEventListener("the event to listen to", function() {
        function_body 
    })

HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION 
    these are those functions which have a function as their arguements 
    like if we made a calculator function which will take three parameters 
        these are the firstNumber , secondNumber , operator(the arithmetic operation to be used)

    here the operator is itself a function which is also defined like add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide()

    (( note )) during the calling of the calculator function the operator parameter  will not have the brackets 

this keyword
    this keyword  references the object that is executing the current function 


    this function is used with addEventListener and queryselectorAll to specify which button triggered the function 


================================================================================================================

OBJECTS 

    objects are like the classes of javascript.
    syntax
        var myFirstObject = {
            property1: value;
            property2: value2;
            property3: value3;
                    .
                    .
                    .
                    .
                    .
            propertyN: valuen;

        }

    the user van change the values of these objects but cannot initialise an object 


CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 

    to initialise an object a different method called the constructor function is used 
    Syntax 
        function myFirstObject(property1, property2, property3 ...... propertyN) {
            this.property1 = property1;
            this.property2 = property2;
        }
    
    in this method an object can be initialised in this way 

    var obj1 = new myFirstObject(value1, value2, value3,................ valueN);
